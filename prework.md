## Prework: Advanced Web Development (WEB103)

Welcome to the CodePath WEB103 Prework!


In WEB103, you will learn how to build your own full stack apps from scratch. But first, it's important that you know how to build a frontend that can interact with an API and supports CRUD operations.

Introducing . . . 🥁

### Creatorverse

A person's top content creators can say a lot about them. Do they prefer lockpicking videos 🔒, casual art streams 🖼️, or hustle-culture TikTokers 📱?

*View an exemplar of the project [here](https://creatorverse-production.up.railway.app/)!*

:::

Your **mission** 🧑‍🚀 is to build a frontend that supports CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on your favorite content creators. Your content creators can be Twitch streamers, YouTube channels, Instagram personalities, TikTok accounts, or similar. Heck, they can even be Mastodon microbloggers.

The **purpose** of your app is to share **at least five** creators you think are worth following and give yourself the ability to create, update, and delete creators. Each `Creator` should have:

- [ ] a `name`
- [ ] a `url` (the link to their channel or page)
- [ ] a `description`
- [ ] (optional) an `imageURL` that links to a picture of the creator or some of their content

You **must** use React to create your app, and you may *optionally* use PicoCSS to style HTML elements.

Let's get started! 🚀

### Required Features

- [ ] Use a logical component structure in React to create the frontend of the app
- [ ] Display **at least five** content creators on the homepage of the app
- [ ] Each content creator item includes:
  - [ ] their `name`
  - [ ] a link to their channel or page
  - [ ] a short description of their content
- [ ] API calls use the async/await design pattern via Axios or fetch
- [ ] Clicking on a content creator item takes the user to their details page, which includes their `name`, `url`, and `description`
- [ ] Each content creator has their own unique URL
- [ ] The user can edit a content creator to change their `name`, `url`, or `description`
- [ ] The user can delete a content creator
- [ ] The user can add a new content creator by entering a `name`, `url`, and `description`
  - [ ] The new content creator then appears in the displayed list

### Stretch Features

- [ ] Use [**Picocss**](https://picocss.com/) to style HTML elements
- [ ] Display content creator items in a creative format, like cards instead of a list
- [ ] Show an image of each content creator on their content creator card

### Step 0: Setting Up Your Project

In WEB103, we'll be using Vite to create our React projects. In this step, you'll use Vite to set up your Creatorverse project. You'll also need React Router to implement navigation between the pages that make up your app.

:::

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Creators

In this step, you'll sign up for [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (or log in if you already have an account) to set up a database for your content creators.

#### Step 1a: Signing up for Supabase

- [ ] Go to the [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) website
- [ ] Sign up for a Supabase account:
  - [ ] Click the green "Start your project" button
  - [ ] At the bottom of the sign-in form, click the "Sign Up Now" link
  - [ ] Create an account using your Github credentials by clicking the "Continue with GitHub" button
- [ ] Create a new project:
  - [ ] Click the green "New project" button to create a new project
  - [ ] Set the name of your project to `creatorverse` and create a database password
  - [ ] Click the green "Create new project" button to submit to form
  - [ ] After submitting the form, give Supabase a few minutes to setup your project

#### Step 1b: Create your database

In this step, you'll create a new Supabase database for your project. You want to save the data for each content creator that is added to your Creatorverse. Your database needs to store the content creator's name, URL, description, and image URL.

- [ ] Click the "Database" icon in the left side bar menu
- [ ] Click the green "New table" button to create a new table in the database
- [ ] Create a `creators` table:
  - [ ] Name the table `creators`
  - [ ] Uncheck the option "Enable Row Level Security"
  - [ ] Check the option "Enable Realtime"
  - [ ] Add columns for `name`, `url`, `description`, and `imageURL`
- [ ] Click the green "Save" button to save the table

#### Step 1c: Connect your project to your database

In this step, you'll add the Supabase client to your project so you can connect the front-end to the database.

- [ ] Install the Supabase library using the following command: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
- [ ] In the `src` directory, create a JavaScript file called `client.js`
- [ ] In `client.js`:
  - [ ] Import `createClient` from Supabase:

    ```js
    import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
    ```

  - [ ] Create a variable called `URL`. Assign it a string containing your Supabase Project URL. To find the Project URL on the Supabase website, click to the "Settings" icon in the left side bar menu and then click "API" under Project Settings. Click "Copy" button under Project URL.

    ```js
    const URL = 'insert your Project URL here';
    ```

    - [ ] Create a variable called `API_KEY`. Assign it a string containing your Supabase Project API Key. To find the Project API Key on the Supabase website, click to the "Settings" icon in the left side bar menu and then click "API" under Project Settings. Click "Copy" button under Project API Key.

    ```js
    const API_KEY = 'insert your Project API key here';
    ```

    - [ ] Create a variable called `supabase`. Assign it a function call to `createClient()`. Pass `URL` and `API_KEY` variables to the `createClient()` function.

    ```js
    const supabase = createClient(URL, API_KEY);
    ```

    - [ ] Export the `supabase` variable by adding the `export` keyword before `const supabase`.

    ```js
    export const supabase = createClient(URL, API_KEY);
    ```

📍 **Checkpoint 0**: After completing Steps 0 and 1, you should now have an empty app that's connected to your database.

### Step 2: Create Pages and Components

Now that you have all the components you need, it's time to build your 💫 Creatorverse! Let's start by creating the components and pages you need.

- [ ] In the `src` directory, create a subdirectory called `components`.
- [ ] In the `components` directory, create a file to represent a content creator. This component should contain the content creator's information (`name`, `url`, `description`, and `imageURL` (optional)) so it can be displayed on the main page. For example, you might want to create a `Card` file to organize a content creator's information on a card.
- [ ] In the `src` directory, create a subdirectory called `pages`.
- [ ] In the `pages` directory, create the pages you need. For example:
  - [ ] a `ShowCreators` page to show all content creators
  - [ ] a `ViewCreator` page to view a single content creator
  - [ ] an `EditCreator` page to allow the user to update a content creator's information
  - [ ] an `AddCreator` page to allow the user to add a new content creator

:::info
💡 **Some Tips to Consider**

Before you start development, take some time to plan out what is needed and how the different parts will look.

Don't forget, a user should be able to:
- View *all* content creators
- View a *single* content creator
- Visit a content creator's channel or page
- Edit a content creator
- Delete a content creator
- Add a content creator
:::

### Step 3: Set Up Routes

In this step, you'll need to create the routes that allow the user to go between each page.

Edit your `App` page by:

- [ ] Importing `useRoutes` from `react-router-dom`
- [ ] Importing your pages for showing all creators, viewing a creator, editing a creator, adding a creator
- [ ] Defining the paths and elements for the main page, edit page, new page, and view page
- [ ] Inserting the element into the `App` container

- [React Router: Getting Started Tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0/getting-started/tutorial)
:::

📍 **Checkpoint 1**: At this point, you should now have your pages and components set up and routes defined to load specific elements when a certain path is reached.

### Step 4: Creating a Component for a Content Creator

Edit the component you created to contain a content creator's information by:

- [ ] Displaying the content creator's name, URL, description, and image

:::info

- [ReactJS: Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [Passing Data Through Props](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#passing-data-through-props)
:::

### Step 5: Viewing All Content Creators

Right now, the user can't see all of the content creators that have been added to the database. In this step, you'll need to make a request to your database to read all the entries and display them on the home page.

Edit your `App` file by:

- [ ] Importing `supabase` from `client.js`
- [ ] Inside a call to the `useEffect()` function, write an asynchronous function to fetch the data from your database. Don't forget to call the function you wrote at the end of the call to `useEffect()`.

Edit the page you created to display all content creators by:

- [ ] Importing the component that displays a content creator's information
- [ ] Creating content creator components for each one in the database
- [ ] Displaying a message if there are no content creators in the database

:::info

- [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs)
- [Supabase JavaScript Library](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction)
:::

📍 **Checkpoint 2**: At this point, you should now have the ability to see content creators on your page. Right now, it might just be displaying the message that there are no content creators because we need to add some!

### Step 6: Viewing a Single Content Creator

When a user clicks on a content creator, they should be taken to a page that allows them to view the single content creator. In this step, you'll need to get the content creator the user clicked on and display their information on the page.

Edit the page you created for viewing a single content creator by:

- [ ] Importing `supabase` from `client.js`
- [ ] Getting the content creator's information from the database
- [ ] Displaying the content creator's name, URL, description, and image

:::info

- [The filter() Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
:::

### Step 7: Adding a Content Creator

Phew! We're doing good so far! Next, let's allow the user to add a content creator to the 💫 Creatorverse.

Edit your home page by:

- [ ] Adding a button on your main page to allow the user to add a content creator
  - [ ] The button should go to the page you created for adding a content creator

Edit the page you created for adding a content creator by:

- [ ] Importing `supabase` from `client.js`
- [ ] Adding a form for the user to enter details about the new content creator (`name`, `url`, `description`, and `imageURL` (optional))
- [ ] Writing an asynchronous function to add the new content creator to the database

:::info

- [ ] [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- [ ] [React Buttons](https://react.school/ui/button)
:::

### Step 8: Updating a Content Creator

The user should also be able to update a content creator...you know, in case someone forgot a link, didn't submit the *best* picture of the content creator, or there are just too many typos for them to ignore ✍️ In this step, you'll need to make a request to your database to update a given content creator and display the changes.

Edit the page you created for editing a content creator by:

- [ ] Importing `supabase` from `client.js`
- [ ] Adding a form for the user to modify the `name`, `url`, `description`, and `imageURL` (optional) for a content creator
- [ ] Getting the content creator's information from the database
- [ ] Loading the content creator's information into the form
- [ ] Writing an asynchronous function to update the content creator in the database
- [ ] Calling the function on a submit button

- [ReactJS: Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
:::

#### Step 8a: Add an Edit Button

Well now that we have the functionality in place, let's go back and add buttons or links to the component for the content creator and/or the page to view a single content creator.

- [ ] On the component for the content creator, add a button or link to edit their information
- [ ] On the page to view a content creator, add a button or link to edit their information

### Step 9: Deleting a Content Creator

Someone might think a content creator isn't really 💫 Creatorverse-worthy...so let's give them the power to delete them! In this step, you'll need to make a request to the database to delete a given content creator from the database and home page.

Edit the page you created for updating a content creator by:

- [ ] Adding a delete button
- [ ] Writing an asynchronous function to delete a content creator from the database
- [ ] Calling the function on the delete button
